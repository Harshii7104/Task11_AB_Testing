A/B Testing Final Recommendation:

- The experiment compared a control group and a test group.
- The statistical test was performed with alpha = 0.05.
- Based on the p-value, we evaluated whether the difference is significant.

Business Decision:
If the test group shows statistically significant improvement,
we recommend rolling out the test version.
Otherwise, retain the control version and test further.
